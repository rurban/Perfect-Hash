=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perfect hashing is a technique for building a static hash table with no
collisions, only lookup, no insert and delete methods. Which means guaranteed
constant O(1) access time, and for minimal perfect hashes even guaranteed
minimal size. It is only possible to build one when we know all of the keys in
advance. Minimal perfect hashing implies that the resulting table contains one
entry for each key, and no empty slots.

As input we need to provide a set of unique keys, either as arrayref or
hashref or as keyfile. The keys can so far only be strings (will be extended
to ints on demand) and the values can so far be only ints and strings.  More
types later.

As generation algorithm there exist various perfect hashing and other fast
lookup methods: Hanov, HanovPP, Urban, CMPH::*, Bob, Nbperf, Pearson*, Gperf, Switch,
and maybe Cuckoo, RobinHood, HAMT, ...  Not all generated lookup methods are
perfect hashes per se. I also implemented traditional methods which might be
faster for smaller key sets, like nested switches, hash array mapped tries or
ordinary open addressing hash tables.

As output there exist several output formater classes, e.g. C and later: XS,
Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, PECL.  For Lua or Lisp this is probably not needed as
they either roll their own, or FFI into the generated C library.  For Go,
Rust, Scala, Clojure, etc just roll you own library, based on an existing one.

The best algorithm used in Hanov and various others is derived from
"Compress, Hash, and Displace algorithm" by Djamal Belazzougui,
Fabiano C. Botelho, and Martin Dietzfelbinger
L<http://cmph.sourceforge.net/papers/esa09.pdf>

=head2 Prior art to pperf

There exist some executables, a library and a simple python script to generate
code to access perfect hashes and minimal versions thereof, but nothing to use
easily. C<gperf> is not very well suited to create big maps and cannot deal
with certain anagrams, but creates fast C code for small dictionaries.

Bob Jenkins' C<perfect> - he called it C<bob>, hence we also - is more stable
than gperf, but requires an external lookup function.

C<Pearson> hashes are simplier and fast for small machines, but not guaranteed
to be creatable for small or bigger hashes.

cmph C<CHD>, C<BDZ_PH> and the other cmph algorithms might be the best
algorithms for big hashes, but lookup time is slower for smaller hashes and
you need to link to an external library.

C<mkhashtable> generates a fast cuckoo hash table for integer lookup.
L<http://www.theiling.de/projects/lookuptable.html>

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new hashref|arrayref|keyfile, algo, options...

Evaluate the best algorithm given the dict size and output options and
generate the minimal perfect hash for the given keys.

The values in the dict are not needed to generate the perfect hash function,
but might be needed later. So you can use either an arrayref where the index
is returned, or a full hashref or a keyfile as with C<gperf>.

Options for output classes are prefixed with C<-for->,
e.g. C<-for-c>. They might be needed to make a better decision which
perfect hash to use.

The following algorithms and options are done and planned:

=over 4

=item -false-positives

Do not store the keys of the hash. Needs much less space and is faster, but
might only be used either if you know in advance that you'll never lookup not
existing keys, or check the result manually by yourself with your already
existing keys array to avoid false positives.

=item -minimal I<(not yet)>

Selects the best available method for a minimal hash, given the
dictionary size, the options, and if the compiled algos are available.

=item -optimal-size I<(not yet)>

Tries various hashes, and uses the one which will create the smallest
hash in memory. Those hashes usually will not store the value, so you
might need to check the result for a false-positive.

=item -optimal-speed I<(not yet)>

Tries various hashes, and uses the one which will use the fastest
lookup.

=item -hanovpp

The default pure perl method, based on CHD.
Hashes the key 1.5x times, same as for Cuckoo hashing.

=item -hanov

Improved version of HanovPP, using optimized XS methods,
2-3x faster with HW supported iSCSI CRC32 (via zlib or manually).

The fast hash function requires a relatively new 64bit Intel, AMD or ARM
processor.  This might need the external zlib library (-lz) at run-time.

=item -urban

Improved version of Hanov, using compressed temp. arrays and
the same optimized XS methods and hash functionsas in -hanov.
But can only store index values in a limited range, not strings.

=item -pearson8

Strict variant of a 8-bit (256 byte) Pearson hash table.  Generates fast
lookups for small 8-bit machines, but limited dictionaries with a 8-bit
pearson table for 5-255 keys.  Returns undef for invalid dictionaries.

=item -pearson

Non-perfect variant with adjusted pearson table size.
Try to find a n-bit sized pearson table for the given
dictionary. Keeps the best found hash table, with no guarantees that
it is a perfect hash table.
If not, collision resolution is done via static binary trees.

This version generates arbitrary sized pearson lookup tables and thus
should be able to find a perfect hash, but success is very
unlikely.

=item -pearsonnp

"np" for non-perfect. Try to find a 8-bit (256 byte) sized pearson table for
the given dictionary. Keeps the best found hash table, with no guarantees that
it is a perfect hash table.  If not, collision resolution is done via static
binary search. I<(currently only linear search)>.

This is also a very fast variant for small 8-bit machines as the 256 byte
table is guaranteed to fit into every CPU cache, but it only iterates
in byte steps.

=item -pearson16 I<(todo, experimental)>

Generate non-perfect pearson hash with an optimized 16bit hash function, a
much bigger 16bit table (size: 65536 shorts), and static binary tree collision
resolution.

=item -pearson32 I<(experimental)>

Generate non-perfect pearson hash with an optimized 32bit hash function,
a pearson table of size 256 and static binary tree collision resolution.

=item -gperf

Generates pretty fast lookup, because it is not hashing the string,
it just takes some characters from the string to create a unique key.
Only limited dictionaries and smaller sizes.

Currently only via the C<gperf> executable. Planned to do it in pure-perl to
be independent and improve the generated memcpy comparisons, as in C<-switch>.

=item -switch

Only for smaller dictionaries.
Uses no hash function nor hash table, just generates a fast switch
table in C<C> as with C<gperf --switch> for smaller dictionaries.

Generates a nested switch table, first switching on the size and then on the
best combination of keys. The difference to C<gperf --switch> is the automatic
generation of nested switch levels, depending on the number of collisions, and
it is optimized to use word size comparisons for the fixed length
comparisons, which is up to 50% faster than C<memcmp>.
The performance is comparable to the best perfect hashes.

=item -bob I<(todo)>

Generates C code more stable than gperf, but requires an external
dependency for the lookup function.

=item -nbperf

Generates NetBSD perfect minimal hashes with the chm algorithm.

Currently only via the C<nbperf> executable, and requires an external
dependency for the hash function. Planned to do it in
pure-perl as with PostgreSQL.

=item -cmph-bdz_ph I<(todo)>

The C<-cmph-*> methods are the current state of the art for bigger
dictionaries.  This needs the external C<cmph> library even at run-time.

The performance depends on the dictionary size.
-cmph-bdz_ph is usually the fastest cmph method for
1.000 - 250.000 keys, and -cmph-chm is usually the second best option.

=item -cmph-bdz I<(todo)>

=item -cmph-bmz I<(todo)>

=item -cmph-chm I<(todo)>

So far this is the most stable variant.

=item -cmph-fch I<(todo)>

=item -cmph-chd_ph I<(todo)>

=item -cmph-chd I<(todo)>

=item -cuckoo I<(not yet)>

Generates good cuckoo tables and hash functions to lookup a string.  Unlike
the other hash tables here this can be extended to dynamic cuckoo hash tables,
by adding insert and delete functions which just resize to dynamic tables.
Cuckoo uses 1.5x hashing of the key (same as -hanov) and requires 2
collision-free lookup arrays.  See L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing>

=item -for-c I<(default)>

Optimize for C libraries

=item -for-xs I<(not yet)>

Optimize for shared Perl XS code. Stores the values as perl types.

=item -for-I<class> I<(not yet)>

Optimize for any I<CLASS> output formatter class, loaded dynamically.
Such as PYTHON, RUBY, JAVA, PHP, PECL, ...

=item -hash=C<name> I<(not yet)>

Use the specified hash function instead of the default.
See C<-hash=help> for a list of all supported hash function names:
C<crc32_zlib>, C<fnv>, C<crc32_sse42>, C<aes>, C<GFMultilinear>...

Only useful for hardware assisted C<crc32>, C<aes> and more C<xmm> system
calls, provided by compiler intrinsics (sse4.2) or libz. Note that some zlib
libraries do not provide a HW-assisted fast crc32 function, rather a slow SW
variant.

The hardware assisted C<crc32> and C<aes> functions add a run-time probe with
slow software fallback code I<(not yet)>. C<crc32_zlib> does all this also, and
is especially optimized for long keys to hash them in parallel, if implemented
in your library.

C<GFMultilinear> for 64bit Intel and AMD
is from L<https://github.com/lemire/StronglyUniversalStringHashing>

=item -pic I<(in work)>

Optimize the generated table for inclusion in shared libraries via a constant
direct stringpool, in contrast to a table of indirect string pointers. This
reduces the startup time of programs using a shared library containing the
generated code. As with L<gperf> C<--pic>

gperf:

C<-P>/C<--pic> does a perfect optimization but may require some small code changes
(see the gperf documentation for details), whereas C<--null-strings> does only a
half-hearted optimization but works without needing any change to surrounding
code.

=item -nul

Allow C<NUL> bytes in keys, i.e. store the length for keys and compare
binary via C<memcmp>. Does not use C<strlen>.

=item -null-strings I<(not yet)>

Use C<NULL> strings instead of empty strings for empty keyword table
entries without C<-false-positives>. This reduces the startup time of
programs using a shared library containing the generated code (but not
as much as the declaration C<-pic> option), at the expense of one more
test-and-branch instruction at run time.

=item -7bit I<(not yet)>

Guarantee that all keys consist only of 7-bit ASCII characters, bytes
in the range 0..127.

=item -ignore-case I<(not yet)>

Consider upper and lower case ASCII characters as equivalent. The
string comparison will use a case insignificant character
comparison. Note that locale dependent case mappings are ignored.

=item -unicode-ignore-case I<(not yet)>

Consider upper and lower case unicode characters as equivalent. The
string comparison will use a case insignificant character
comparison. Note that locale dependent case mappings are planned to be done via
C<libicu> or the better C<libunistring>.
